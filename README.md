## Overview

OBSIDIAN Neural is an open source VST3/AU plugin for real-time AI music generation directly in your DAW. This repository contains the **provider kit**: a FastAPI inference server you run on your machine to contribute your GPU to the distributed generation network.

## How it works

```
Musician in their DAW
        ↓ types a prompt
OBSIDIAN Neural central server
        ↓ finds an available GPU in the pool
Your machine (provider)
        ↓ generates audio with Stable Audio
        ↓ returns validated WAV
Musician receives the sound in real time
```

Subscription revenue is redistributed **equally** among all active providers each month via Stripe Connect, after deduction of a 15% platform fee covering infrastructure costs (fal.ai, hosting, maintenance). This fee is published publicly each month.

## Installation

### Linux / macOS

```bash
git clone https://github.com/innermost47/obsidian-neural-provider.git
cd obsidian-neural-provider
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh
```

### Windows

```bat
git clone https://github.com/innermost47/obsidian-neural-provider.git
cd obsidian-neural-provider
install.bat
```

The scripts automatically detect your GPU and install the correct PyTorch version (CUDA 11.8, CUDA 12.1, ROCm, or CPU).

## Configuration

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill it in:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

```env
PROVIDER_API_KEY=op_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
CENTRAL_SERVER_URL=https://api.obsidian-neural.com
MODEL=stable-audio-open-1.0
HOST=0.0.0.0
PORT=8000

```

| Variable             | Description                                                      |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `PROVIDER_API_KEY`   | Key provided by the OBSIDIAN Neural admin — **never share this** |
| `CENTRAL_SERVER_URL` | Central server URL                                               |
| `MODEL`              | `stable-audio-open-1.0` or `stable-audio-open-small`             |
| `HOST`               | Listening interface (0.0.0.0 = all)                              |
| `PORT`               | Server port (default: 8000)                                      |
| `HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL` | Heartbeat frequency in seconds (default: 300)                    |

---

## Starting the server

```bash
source venv/bin/activate   # Linux/macOS
venv\Scripts\activate.bat  # Windows

python provider.py
```

CLI arguments override `.env` if needed:

```bash
python provider.py --key op_xxx --model stable-audio-open-small --port 8002 --server https://api.obsidian-neural.com
```

## Models

| Model                     | VRAM    | Quality | Speed (RTX 3070) | Download size |
| ------------------------- | ------- | ------- | ---------------- | ------------- |
| `stable-audio-open-1.0`   | ~7-8 GB | ⭐⭐⭐  | ~30-120s         | ~5 GB         |
| `stable-audio-open-small` | ~3-4 GB | ⭐⭐    | ~5-15s           | ~1.5 GB       |

First launch downloads the model from HuggingFace. Subsequent launches are instant (cached model).

---

## Endpoints

| Method | Route       | Auth | Description                      |
| ------ | ----------- | ---- | -------------------------------- |
| `GET`  | `/status`   | ✅   | Availability + model info + VRAM |
| `POST` | `/generate` | ✅   | Audio generation → WAV bytes     |
| `GET`  | `/health`   | ❌   | Server health                    |

Authentication via `X-API-Key` header.

---

## Heartbeat

The provider automatically sends a heartbeat to the central server every 5 minutes (configurable via `HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL`). This lets the central server know your machine is online, independently of random pings.

---

## Monthly redistribution

```
Monthly revenue
    - 15% platform fee (fal.ai + hosting + maintenance)
    = Distributable amount
        ÷ nb eligible providers
        = Equal share per provider
```

Example with 180€ and 6 providers:

```
180€ - 27€ = 153€ → 25.50€ per provider
```

**Eligibility:**

1. Uptime ≥ 60% of random pings that month
2. At least 1 real job processed during the month

Pings are sent at **random times** to prevent cron-based cheating. The platform fee and redistributed amounts are published publicly each month on the central server.

---

## Security

- Your server only receives the optimized prompt — never user personal data
- The central server validates every WAV via FFmpeg before sending it to the musician
- An invalid WAV results in an **immediate ban**
- Never share your `PROVIDER_API_KEY`

## Public Statistics

The central server exposes the number of active subscribers in real time:

```
GET https://api.obsidian-neural.com/api/v1/public/stats
```

Response:

```json
{
  "paying_users": 42,
  "updated_at": "2026-03-28T14:32:00Z"
}
```

This endpoint is public and requires no authentication. It allows every provider to verify the platform's growth and estimate their monthly share.

Combined with `public/finances`, you get a complete and transparent view of the network's financial health:

| Source                     | Data                                  |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `/api/v1/public/stats`     | Active subscribers count in real time |
| `/api/v1/public/finances`  | Monthly redistribution history        |
| `/api/v1/public/ownership` | Proof of generation ownership         |

---

## Benchmarking

Before joining the network, run the local benchmark to verify your GPU meets the minimum speed requirements.
This test loads each model directly on your GPU, runs several generations, and reports your eligibility — no network call required.

```bash
python benchmark.py
```

To test a specific model only:

```bash
python benchmark.py --model stable-audio-open-small
python benchmark.py --model stable-audio-open-1.0
```

Options:

| Flag          | Description                                                            |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--model`     | `stable-audio-open-1.0`, `stable-audio-open-small`, or `all` (default) |
| `--runs`      | Number of benchmark runs per model (default: 3)                        |
| `--no-warmup` | Skip the warmup run                                                    |

**Eligibility thresholds:**

| Model                     | Max average time for 10s audio |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| `stable-audio-open-1.0`   | 60s                            |
| `stable-audio-open-small` | 20s                            |

A provider scoring above threshold on both models is not eligible for the network.
The benchmark also reports the **Real-Time Factor (RTF)**: a value above `x1.0` means your GPU generates audio faster than it plays.

---

## Joining the network

1. Check that you have the minimum required GPU
2. Open a **GitHub Discussion** on [innermost47/ai-dj](https://github.com/innermost47/ai-dj/discussions) with your GPU model and preferred inference model
3. The admin sends you your API key
4. Copy `.env.example` → `.env`, fill in your key, start the provider

The pool is limited to **10 providers** in phase 1.
